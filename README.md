# .dotfiles
A set of my dotfiles containing configuration options that I use -- feel free to use them too

Note: There is a high chance that somewhere in here I've accidentally left a file that contains some sort of credentials, api tokens or similar<br/>
Please please please if you find such a file report it to me at my email `nathanturner3665 ~ gmail ~ com` or if it's less sensitive then use issues. If you have an easy and quick way to reset the token you may also do that.
